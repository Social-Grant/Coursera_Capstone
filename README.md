# Coursera_Capstone
IBM Coursera Capstone Project

This repository revolves around the Applied Data Science Capstone course offered by IBM through Coursera.

The "Final Coursera Data Science Capstone project.ipynb" notebook contains a mark down cell as well as basic Python code as 
as required for the first weeks assessment.

The "Segmenting & Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto.ipynb", "Segmenting & Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto p2.ipynb " and
"Segmenting & Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto P3.ipynb" notebooks contain the Python code for scraping data from Wikipedia, creating data frames, "One Hot encoding" the data, training and testing a K-Means model, segmenting and clustering the results as well as plotting them on a map.

The battle of the Neighborhoods is the final project and required us to come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of our choice or to come up with a problem that could use the Foursquare location data to solve. The battle of the Neighborhoods files contain the final project files for week four and week 5 as follows:

The "Battle of the Neighborhoods.pdf" file contains a description of the problem and a discussion of the background and a description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

The "Battle of the Neighborhoods.ipynb" notebook contains the Python coding to solve the problem.

The "Battle of the Neighborhoods report.pdf" file contains an introduction discussing the business problem and who would be interested in this project; data where to describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data; a methodology section which represents the main component of the report where discussing and describing any exploratory data analysis that done, any inferential statistical testing that performed, and what machine learnings were used and why; results section discussing the results; discussion section where discussing any observations noted and any recommendations based on the results; and a conclusion section where concluding the report.
